title: Deploy on Railway
---

Deploy OpenClaw on Railway with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Railway runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## Quick checklist (new users)

1. **Fork or clone** the OpenClaw repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a new Railway project** from your GitHub repo.
3. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data`.
4. Set the required **Variables** (at least `SETUP_PASSWORD`).
5. **Generate Domain** to get a public URL.
6. Open `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` and finish the wizard.

## Method 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

This method allows you to track updates and customize your deployment.

### Step 1: Prepare your repository

Fork or clone the OpenClaw repository:

```bash
gh repo fork openclaw/openclaw --clone
cd openclaw
```

Or manually fork it on GitHub at https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw

### Step 2: Create Railway project

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/) and sign in
2. Click **New Project**
3. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. Choose your forked `openclaw` repository
5. Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` configuration and build from the Dockerfile

### Step 3: Configure the service

After Railway creates the service, configure it:

**Add a Volume:**
- Go to your service → **Settings** → **Volumes**
- Click **New Volume**
- Mount Path: `/data`
- Size: At least 1GB

**Set Environment Variables:**
- Go to **Variables** tab
- Add these required variables:
  ```
  SETUP_PASSWORD = (your secure password for /setup access)
  PORT = 8080
  OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR = /data/.openclaw
  OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR = /data/workspace
  OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN = (generate a random secure token)
  ```

**Generate Domain:**
- Go to **Settings** → **Networking**
- Click **Generate Domain** to get your public URL (like `https://<something>.up.railway.app`)

### Step 4: Access your deployment

Once deployed, Railway will provide a public URL. Then open:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` — setup wizard (password protected)
- `https://<your-railway-domain>/openclaw` — Control UI

## Method 2: One-click deploy (Template)

<a href="https://railway.com/deploy/clawdbot-railway-template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  Deploy on Railway
</a>

Use the template link above (if available). Follow the same configuration steps from Method 1 after deployment.

## What you get

- Hosted OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI
- Web setup wizard at `/setup` (no terminal commands)
- Persistent storage via Railway Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys
- Backup export at `/setup/export` to migrate off Railway later

## Configuration details

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SETUP_PASSWORD` | Yes | - | Password for accessing `/setup` wizard |
| `PORT` | Yes | `8080` | Port the gateway listens on (must match Railway's exposed port) |
| `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` | Yes | `/data/.openclaw` | Where OpenClaw stores config and credentials |
| `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Yes | `/data/workspace` | Workspace directory for agent files |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | Recommended | - | Admin token for gateway API access (generate a secure random string) |

### Volume configuration

Railway requires a persistent volume to survive redeploys:

- **Mount Path**: `/data`
- **Size**: At least 1GB (adjust based on your workspace needs)

Without a volume, all configuration and workspace data will be lost on each deploy.

### Networking

Railway automatically handles networking when you generate a domain:

- The service listens on `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (configured via `--bind lan` flag)
- Railway proxies HTTPS traffic to your container
- No additional port configuration needed

## Setup flow

1. Visit `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup` and enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
2. Choose a model/auth provider and paste your key.
3. (Optional) Add Telegram/Discord/Slack tokens.
4. Click **Run setup**.

If Telegram DMs are set to pairing, the setup wizard can approve the pairing code.

## Getting chat tokens

### Telegram bot token

1. Message `@BotFather` in Telegram
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Copy the token (looks like `123456789:AA...`)
4. Paste it into `/setup`

### Discord bot token

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. **New Application** → choose a name
3. **Bot** → **Add Bot**
4. **Enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** under Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents (required or the bot will crash on startup)
5. Copy the **Bot Token** and paste into `/setup`
6. Invite the bot to your server (OAuth2 URL Generator; scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`)

## Backups & migration

Download a backup at:

- `https://<your-railway-domain>/setup/export`

This exports your OpenClaw state + workspace so you can migrate to another host without losing config or memory.
